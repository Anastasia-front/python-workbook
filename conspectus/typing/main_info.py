"""
Programming languages can be statically or dynamically typed. 
A statically typed language performs type checking at compile time, 
while a dynamically typed language performs it at runtime.


Languages can also be weakly and strongly typed. A strongly typed language 
has stricter rules such as variable assignments, return values, and function calls, 
while loosely typed ones can produce unpredictable results. Python is a dynamic language with strong typing.



Since Python 3.5, type hinting has officially become part of the language (PEP 484).



Using a linter or code inspection tool, developers can check the consistency of variables 
and their types in the codebase and perform static analysis of code that would previously 
be difficult or impossible. All this is done in advance, before running the code.


Python does not use type hints at runtime. All information about the type will be removed
when the program is launched. Type hinting is used by Python in advance, in the type checking system you use,
such as the VSCode editor or the PyCharm IDE. In other words, type hinting in Python is for the developer, not the runtime."""
