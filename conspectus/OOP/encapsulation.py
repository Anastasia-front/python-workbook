"""
Encapsulation in programming, in particular in object-oriented programming (OOP), 
is one of the key principles, which consists in hiding the internal structure 
of a class and protecting its data from direct access from the outside. 
This principle allows you to restrict access to certain components of a class 
(fields and methods), providing control over how this data is used and changed.

With the help of class attributes and methods, we perform encapsulation â€” 
we hide the implementation details under the class interface."""

# In general, encapsulation in OOP is implemented through the use of
# public, protected, and private attributes and methods.

public = "the element is available from anywhere in the program."
protected = "an element is available from the class in which it is declared, \
as well as from derived classes."
private = "an element is available only from the class in which it is declared."

# Protected attributes and methods

"""
They are indicated by a single underscore _ at the beginning of the name. 
This is just a convention, and protected attributes may still be accessible 
from the outside, but it is considered bad practice to change them from the outside.

The correct approach is to provide access to protected attributes through public methods, 
which may include additional processing or validation logic, 
thereby maintaining security and data integrity within the class.

If we want to interact with the object's protected fields from the outside, 
we need to implement a proper encapsulation approach in the Person class 
and use methods to interact with such object attributes
